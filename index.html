  <h1>What is vr?</h1>
  <p>Virtual reality, also called virtual reality, is a computer technique in which a realistic situation is imitated in a simulated environment.
        To experience this situation, you need to put on special virtual reality glasses or head-mounted display 
        <br>
         Unlike traditional interfaces such as a computer screen, virtual reality places the user in the middle of an immersive environment.
  
       The VR glasses contain a screen and close off the user's view of the outside world.
        The screen is divided in two between the user's eyes.
         This creates a stereoscopic 3D effect, which simulates the feeling of depth.
          By stimulating as many senses as possible, such as seeing, hearing or smelling, the user's reality is transformed into an artificial world.</p>
